during my update of ccdocker I ran into multiple issues with it
- original servers being dead
- public server code being diffrent from what would of been used
- computercraft api issues
- fs not working 
- only image being craftos 1.7

## fixes
- now uses a github repo to list containers, and github releases for said containers
- some computercraft api inclusions
